## Food for Thought

Isnâ€™t funny how 2-bits seems to be natural evolution for LLMs? Like DNA which consists of 4 letters (A,T,G,C) or operates on 2-bits. In order to run an LLM, all you need is a weight matrix and a run file (e.g. [llama2.c](https://github.com/karpathy/llama2.c)), just like a DNA.

So, *what is the run.c function for DNA?* 

I think we will learn the answer soon.
